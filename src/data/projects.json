Backend: NestJS, PostgreSQL (Prisma), MongoDB (activity logs). Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router, React 18, TanStack Query. Payments: Stripe and M-Pesa adapters, idempotent intents, verified webhooks.

The system is designed under the assumption that failures are normal, not exceptional: caches can fail, logs can be unavailable, and callbacks can be delayed or duplicated. Each failure mode is handled explicitly with timeouts, retries with backoff, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation. Security-first baselines include JWT authentication, input validation, rate limiting, callback IP allowlisting, network isolation via Docker, and TLS at the edge (Cloudflare).
