# I Built the Same App in React, Vue, and Angular: Here's What I Learned in 2025

*A real-world comparison of modern frontend frameworks through three production applications*

![Framework Comparison Banner](/assets/blog/framework-comparison-2025.jpg)

## TL;DR (The Impatient Developer's Version)
- üèÜ **Built 3 similar apps:** Finance Tracker (Vue), Fitness Scheduler (Angular), Habit Tracker (React)
- üí° **Key findings:** Each framework shines in different scenarios
- üéØ **Quick picks:**
  - Vue 3 for rapid development and simple state management
  - Angular for enterprise-grade applications
  - React for maximum flexibility and ecosystem

## The Challenge: Same Core Features, Different Frameworks

Ever had that conversation where developers argue about which framework is "the best"? Yeah, me too. So instead of theorizing, I decided to put them to the test by building similar applications with each framework. Here's what I built:

- **[Personal Finance Tracker](https://tracks-finances.netlify.app)** (Vue.js 3)
- **[Fitness Class Scheduler](https://fitnessss-tracker.netlify.app)** (Angular 20)
- **[Habit Tracker & Streak Counter](https://habitss-tracker.netlify.app)** (React 19)

Each app needed similar core features:
- Data visualization with charts
- Complex state management
- User preferences (dark/light mode)
- Responsive design
- Local data persistence

## The Development Experience

### üü¢ Vue.js 3 (Personal Finance Tracker)

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import { useStorage } from '@vueuse/core'

const expenses = useStorage('expenses', [])
const totalExpenses = computed(() => 
  expenses.value.reduce((sum, exp) => sum + exp.amount, 0)
)
</script>
```

**What I Loved:**
- Composition API is a joy to work with
- Amazing developer experience out of the box
- Template syntax is intuitive for designers
- Small learning curve for new developers

**Pain Points:**
- TypeScript support is good but not great
- Some ecosystem packages still catching up to Vue 3
- SSR setup requires more configuration than Next.js

### üîµ Angular (Fitness Class Scheduler)

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-schedule',
  template: `
    <div class="schedule-grid">
      <app-class-card
        *ngFor="let class of classes$ | async"
        [class]="class"
        (booked)="handleBooking($event)"
      />
    </div>
  `
})
export class ScheduleComponent {
  classes$ = this.classService.getClasses();
}
```

**What I Loved:**
- Built-in dependency injection
- TypeScript first-class support
- Excellent CLI tools
- Great for large teams

**Pain Points:**
- More verbose than React/Vue
- Steeper learning curve
- Bundle size needs attention

### ‚öõÔ∏è React (Habit Tracker)

```jsx
const HabitTracker = () => {
  const [habits, setHabits] = useState([])
  const streakCount = useMemo(() => 
    calculateStreaks(habits), [habits]
  )

  return (
    <div className="habit-grid">
      {habits.map(habit => 
        <HabitCard 
          key={habit.id}
          habit={habit}
          streak={streakCount[habit.id]}
        />
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What I Loved:**
- Huge ecosystem
- Flexible architecture
- Great documentation
- Simple mental model

**Pain Points:**
- Too many ways to do the same thing
- State management requires decisions
- Setup requires more configuration

## Performance Showdown

Here's what I measured across all three apps:

| Metric | Vue | Angular | React |
|--------|-----|---------|-------|
| Initial Load | 1.2s | 1.8s | 1.4s |
| Time to Interactive | 2.1s | 2.7s | 2.3s |
| Bundle Size | 82KB | 128KB | 98KB |
| Lighthouse Score | 97 | 94 | 96 |

*Note: All measurements taken with similar features and production builds*

## The Plot Twist: It's Not About the Framework

Here's the thing - after building these apps, I realized something crucial: **the framework matters less than we think**. What really matters is:

1. **Your Team's Expertise:** Use what your team knows best
2. **Project Requirements:** Some frameworks do suit certain projects better
3. **Ecosystem Needs:** Consider what additional libraries you'll need
4. **Long-term Maintenance:** Think about who will maintain the code

## Real Talk: Which One Would I Choose Today?

If I were starting a new project in 2025, here's my decision tree:

- **Choose Vue if:**
  - You want the gentlest learning curve
  - You need great performance out of the box
  - Your team includes designers who code

- **Choose Angular if:**
  - You're building enterprise software
  - You want strong conventions
  - Your team is large and needs structure

- **Choose React if:**
  - You want maximum flexibility
  - You need the largest ecosystem
  - You're building a complex, long-term project

## Lessons Learned

1. **Framework wars are overrated.** They're all capable of building great apps.
2. **Developer experience matters more** than minor performance differences.
3. **Each framework has its sweet spot.** Choose based on your specific needs.
4. **The ecosystem is crucial.** Consider the available libraries and tools.
